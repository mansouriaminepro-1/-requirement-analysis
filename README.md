**The Requirement Analysis Project** 
provides a structured approach to understanding and documenting software requirements. Through this project, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. The focus is on clarity, organization, and precision, simulating real-world software development practices to lay a strong foundation for successful project execution.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of gathering, examining, and defining the needs and expectations for a software system. It identifies what the system should do, how it should behave, and under what constraints it must operate. This phase transforms stakeholder ideas and business needs into clear, testable, and prioritized requirements that guide design, development, and testing.

### Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
Requirement Analysis is crucial because it:

- **Ensures clarity and understanding:** Aligns developers, stakeholders, and users on what the system should deliver.
- **Defines scope:** Prevents misunderstandings and scope creep by setting clear boundaries.
- **Saves time and cost:** Detects issues early, reducing expensive fixes later in the development process.
- **Supports quality assurance:** Provides the foundation for testing and verifying the software.
- **Reduces risk:** Identifies conflicts, ambiguities, and feasibility concerns early.
- **Aligns with business goals:** Ensures the final software meets user needs and organizational objectives.
